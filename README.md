# coding_challenges

The goal here is to compile a comprehensive list of coding challenges for intermediate coders of various languages.

Feel free to drop challenging code snippets (from a project you're doing) that others may benefit from reading it.

If you add a file, use the format: "type of debugging error i.e syntax"_"language"_'number'
