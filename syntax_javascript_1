Where is the syntax error?

objects = {
  [protagonist : new character(30,30,"red",30,170)],
  [obstacle1 : new character(15, 30, "brown", 200, 170)],
  [landscape : new character(480, 270, "green", 0, 200)]
}

{} is used for objects
[] is used for arrays,
[] should be removed, replaced with {} to make an object of objects
